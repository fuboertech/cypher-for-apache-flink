== SQL PGDS

The most powerful PGDS is the SQL PGDS.
It allows the extraction of graphs from any system that understands SQL.
In particular, Hive and JDBC are the two interfaces used.

The SQL PGDS is configured using a JSON file which contains parameters necessary to connect across JDBC or to Hive.

.Example SQL PGDS configuration
====

[source, scala]
----
include::{snippets-dir}/SqlPGDS.scala[tags=create-sql-pgds]
----

This example creates a SQL PGDS configured to read both from Hive and from an embedded H2 SQL database.

====

The graphs that a SQL PGDS stores are defined by their Graph DDL, which expresses graph schema and mappings from views and tables available in the configured data sources.

.Graph DDL example (located at /path/to/my/Graph.ddl)
====

[source, "graph ddl"]
----
include::{snippets-res-dir}/SqlPGDS.ddl[tags=full-example]
----

The above Graph DDL requires two tables (with columns): `view_KNOWS (start_id, end_id, since)` and `view_Persons (id, name)` to be present in the catalog of `myH2Source.myH2Schema` (the `myH2Schema` schema of the H2 database).

====


[[backend-sql-pgds-tables]]
=== Tables and columns

The referenced tables are required to contain all the columns referenced in the Graph DDL.
The tables may contain additional columns not referenced in the Graph DDL.
Such additional columns will not be selected.

Mappings are not case sensitive.
A table `person(NAME varchar, AGE bigint, HOMETOWN varchar)` can be mapped into a label `(Person {name: STRING, age: INTEGER, homeTown: String})`.
The resulting graph will follow the case specified in the schema.
Cypher is case sensitive.
To query a graph created with this mapping, the label and property names used in the query must match the case in the graph:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.name = 'Tobias' AND p.homeTown = 'Malm√∂'
RETURN avg(p.age)
----
