This chapter documents the CAPS session, catalog and backends.

// TODO: Consider folding session+catalog into in-memory backend.

Using CAPS, graphs can be created from one or more backends, queried with Cypher, and optionally persisted back to one or more backends.
A CAPS application performs work through a <<caps-session, CAPS Session>>.
The session maintains references to one or more graphs in a _Catalog_.

The following backends are supported in CAPS and can be used in a CAPS application:

* <<backend-in-memory, In-memory backend>>
* <<backend-filesystem, Filesystem backend>>
* <<backend-neo4j, Neo4j backend>>
* <<backend-sql, SQL backend>>
