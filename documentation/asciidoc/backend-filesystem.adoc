[[pgds-filesystem]]
== Filesystem PGDS

The most basic PGDS sort are the filesystem PGDSs.
These store graphs as files in a specific file format in the "tables for labels" layout.
That is, there will be a directory for each label combination in the graph, where nodes that contain that label combination are stored in tables.
Similarly, relationships are stored in tables grouped by their relationship types.

The files can be stored in local filesystem or in the Hadoop filesystem, as determined by the PGDS configuration.

Additionally, the filesystem PGDS integrate with Hive, allowing the creation of Hive tables for each label combination.
These may then be queried using standard Spark SQL, or used as input to SQL PGDS-hosted graphs.
