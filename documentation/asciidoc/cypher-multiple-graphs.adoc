= Multiple-Graph support

[abstract]
--
This section describes Cypher multiple graph support in CAPS.
--

Neo4j CAPS ships with novel Cypher features under the title of Multiple-Graphs.
These enable a single Cypher query to reference and query several graphs.
Cypher queries may also define new graphs, add them to the catalog of graphs, and return graphs as results.


.Multiple graph query overview:
====

Consider below _Query 1_, where the intent is to integrate data from two different graphs and construct a new graph.

.Query 1
[source, cypher]
----
CATALOG CREATE GRAPH integrations.person-customer { // <1>
  FROM allFriends                                   // <2>
  MATCH (p:Person)                                  // <3>
  FROM purchases.products                           // <4>
  MATCH (c:Customer)                                // <5>
  WHERE c.email = p.email                           // <6>
  CONSTRUCT                                         // <7>
    ON purchases.products, allFriends               // <8>
    CREATE (c)-[:IS]->(p)                           // <9>
                                                    // <10>
  RETURN GRAPH                                      // <11>
}                                                   // <12>

<1> `CATALOG CREATE GRAPH` is a _catalog DDL clause_; it adds a graph to the catalog under the given name `integrations.person-customer`.
<2> The `FROM` clause sets the working graph (the graph from which patterns are matched) to be the `allFriends` graph.
<3> Standard Cypher 9 `MATCH` clause.
    This matches from the `allFriends` graph.
<4> Sets the working graph to `purchases.products`.
<5> As 2, except this matches from the `purchases.products` graph.
<6> Standard Cypher 9 `WHERE` sub-clause.
<7> The `CONSTRUCT` clause defines a new graph.
<8> The `ON` sub-clause allows graphs to be build on the union of a set of other graphs.
    The constructed graph is here set to include everything from the `purchases.products` and `allFriends` graphs.
<9> `CREATE` is here a sub-clause to `CONSTRUCT` in which new patterns may be defined for inclusion in the constructed graph.
    The `c` nodes from `purchases.products` are here connected to the `p` nodes from the `allFriends` graph.
<10> This line doesn't mean anything in particular but at this point the working graph has been changed to the newly constructed anonymous graph defined by the `CONSTRUCT` clause.
<11> `RETURN GRAPH` returns the working graph as a result of the query.
     This will return the newly constructed graph.
<12> Denotes the end of the catalog query.
     Catalog queries are required to return a graph; returning a table is invalid.

In looser terms, what the above query illustrates is a way to connect two disparate graphs.
In this case, our simple predicate defines that `:Person` nodes and `:Customer` nodes represent the same real person if their `email` properties are equal.
The two graphs `allFriends` and `purchases.products` are here merged into a single graph and connected through `:IS` relationships.
This new graph is then added to the catalog as `integrations.person-customer`, and may be referenced by a subsequent query.

As graphs are managed through the federated catalog, the graph will actually be stored as a graph `person-customer` in the PGDS registered at the `integrations` namespace. See other chapters on PGDSs for more details.

Alternatively, if the wrapping `CATALOG CREATE GRAPH` clause is omitted, the query will return the resulting graph to the user for further in-memory processing.
Indeed, another Cypher query may be executed on the new graph.
This effectively allows the construction of chains of queries on top of one another, in a pattern of _composition_, which is not possible in Cypher 9.

[[mg-cypher-background]]
== Background

Cypher is a language that is approaching standardisation.
To this end the openCypher Implementers Group (oCIG) accepted a retroactive specification for Cypher 9, which includes most of the language as it has come to be known from its use in the Neo4j database.
The https://s3.amazonaws.com/artifacts.opencypher.org/openCypher9.pdf[Cypher 9 specification] may be found on the https://www.opencypher.org[opencypher.org] website, along with many other Cypher materials and resources.

Now, the openCypher project is leading the standardisation of Cypher 10, which will include a chapter on Multiple-Graphs.
Neo4j CAPS is the first implementation of the features proposed for Cypher 10 Multiple-Graphs.


[[mg-cypher-caps-and-neo4j]]
== Cypher in Cypher for Apache Spark and Neo4j

Neo4j supports full Cypher 9 plus specific extensions.
CAPS supports a subset of Cypher 9 plus Multiple-Graphs from Cypher 10.
Across successive versions, these discrepancies will be removed.
// TODO: Link to more details

Due to the domain of CAPS being a popular integration platform in Apache Spark, the capability of referencing multiple, distinct graphs is a key feature.
Similar to how the `SparkSession` manages tables in a catalog, the `CAPSSession` manages _named_ graphs in a catalog.
This enables referencing of graphs very similarly to how SQL references tables.


[[mg-cypher-named-graphs]]
== Named graphs and the catalog

In Neo4j CAPS graphs are stored in a centrally managed, federated graph catalog.
In this catalog graphs are distinguished by their _qualified graph names_.
A qualified graph name consists of two or more parts, separated by a dot character (`.`), where the first part is called a _namespace_.
The namespace is the handle to which the Property Graph Data Sources (PGDSs) are registered; all graphs managed by a PGDS registered at the namespace `foo` must be referenced with `foo.<name of graph>`.
These namespaces are fully user-defined and may be any valid Cypher identifier.

Since PGDSs represent physical storage in various distinct actual locations, this namespacing scheme effectively makes the graph catalog federated, as it manages graphs across all PGDSs.


[[mg-working-graph]]
== Working graph

A Cypher query always works within the context of a _working graph_.
In Cypher 9, this was implicitly defined by the system.
In Cypher 10, this may be controlled from within the query.
The working graph is the graph on which pattern matches operate.
To set the working graph, use a `FROM` clause.


[[mg-from-clause]]
== FROM

The `FROM` clause is used to set the working graph.

.Layout of the `FROM` clause:
[source, cypher]
----
FROM [GRAPH] <graph-name>
----


[[mg-return-graph]]
== RETURN GRAPH

The `RETURN GRAPH` clause is used to return the working graph as the query result.

.Layout of the `RETURN GRAPH` clause:
[source, cypher]
----
RETURN GRAPH
----

When the query ends with a `RETURN GRAPH` clause, there will be no tabular result.
In other words, all queries have to choose whether to return a graph or to return a table.


[[mg-graph-construct]]
== CONSTRUCT

In Multiple-Graphs Cypher, new graphs may be constructed within a query by using the `CONSTRUCT` clause.
A `CONSTRUCT` clause is made up of three parts: an `ON` clause, `CREATE` clauses, and `SET` clauses.

.Layout of the `CONSTRUCT` clause:
[source, cypher]
----
CONSTRUCT
  [ON <graph-name-list>]
  [CREATE <pattern> | SET <set-expression>]*
----

At the end of a `CONSTRUCT` clause, the working graph is set to be the newly constructed graph.
In the below example, we construct an empty graph and return it.
Note that the previous working graph `graph1` is not being returned.

.Construct an empty graph:
[source, cypher]
----
FROM graph1
CONSTRUCT
RETURN GRAPH
----

[NOTE]
`CONSTRUCT` will clear the query scope of any bound variables, and set the binding table to a single row.


[[mg-construct-on]]
=== ON

The `ON` clause is optional.
It may be used to specify one or more graphs which will form the basis of the constructed graph.
Multiple arguments are separated by a comma (`,`).
The referenced graphs will be combined into a single graph by adding all of their nodes and relationships.
This is identical to performing a non-distinct `UNION` over all of the referenced graphs.

.Construct the union of three graphs:
====
[source, cypher]
----
CONSTRUCT
  ON graph1, graph2, graph3
RETURN GRAPH
----

The above example query produces the same graph as a result as using the Scala API like this:

[source, scala]
----
val caps: CAPSSession = ...
val graph1 = caps.catalog("graph1")
val graph2 = caps.catalog("graph2")
val graph3 = caps.catalog("graph3")

val result = graph1.unionAll(graph2, graph3)
----
====


[[mg-create]]
=== CREATE

The `CREATE` clause is very similar to the Cypher 9 `CREATE` clause, with two main differences.
First, it does not cause any side effects to any pre-existing graphs.
Second, it may use a pattern construct called `COPY OF`.

Nodes of a `CREATE` pattern with anonymous or unbound variables will cause the creation of a new node.
Bound variables will not be created, but will be cloned into the constructed graph.

[NOTE]
If the `CONSTRUCT` is `ON` the same graph that the bound node was matched from, the node will not cause a duplicate to be cloned. Instead, any new relationships or properties will be set on the one instance of this node.


[[mg-copy-of]]
==== COPY OF

The `COPY OF` pattern operator may be used to copy all labels and properties of a bound node or relationship onto a new one.

.Copy the relationships between all pair of nodes:
[source, cypher]
----
FROM graph1
MATCH (n)-[r]->(m)
CONSTRUCT ON graph1
  CREATE (n)-[COPY OF r]->(m)
RETURN GRAPH
----


[[mg-set]]
=== SET

The `SET` clause is identical to `SET` in Cypher 9, with the exception of operating only over the constructed graph.

.Set a property on all the nodes of a graph:
[source, cypher]
----
FROM graph1
MATCH (n)
CONSTRUCT
  ON graph1
  SET n.prop = 15
RETURN GRAPH
----
