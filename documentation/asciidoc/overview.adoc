This chapter provides an overview of CAPS components: Property Graph Data Source backends and the Cypher graph query language.

[[caps-components]]
== Components

Cypher for Apache Spark is made up of Property Graph Data Sources (PGDSs) -- software components for loading and saving graphs from various locations -- and the Cypher graph query language.


[[introduction-pgds]]
=== Property Graph Data Sources

The following Property Graph Data Sources are available:

* FileSystem
* Neo4j
* SQL


[[introduction-filesystem-pgds]]
==== FileSystem PGDS

The FileSystem PGDS can be used to load and save graphs in various formats stored in one of the supported file systems.
The supported file systems are:

* HDFS
* local FS
* S3

The supported file formats are:

* Parquet
* ORC
* CSV


[[introduction-neo4j-pgds]]
==== Neo4j PGDS

The Neo4j PGDS can be used to load and save graphs from a Neo4j graph database.
Using the Neo4j PGDS, it is possible to, among other things:

* Store multiple graphs in Neo4j.
* Synchronising Neo4j DB with other data sources.


[[introduction-sql-pgds]]
==== SQL PGDS

The SQL PGDS can be used to load and save graphs from different SQL backends.
With the SQL PGDS comes Graph DDL, a novel language to express Graph Schema, and an extension to the SQL language for expressing how SQL tables and view map to graphs.
Graph DDL can be used to pull one or more graphs from SQL-interfaced systems, such as Hive, or a relational database.


[[introduction-cypher]]
=== Cypher

Read-only part of Cypher 9.
Cypher 10 Multiple-Graph extensions -- a set of changes to the core Cypher language itself, that make it possible to query multiple named graphs in the same query.


[[introduction-language-support]]
== Language support

At the present time, only Scala is supported.
As such, this documentation makes reference to Scala code snippets and conventions.
// TODO: Is this true?
Because Scala compiles down to class files, you can probably use it with Java, but it might not be idiomatic.
